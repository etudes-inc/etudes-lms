			<h4 style="text-align:center">About ETUDES-NG </h4>
			
			<p>ETUDES-NG (Next Generation) provides a rich, easy-to-use web-based teaching and learning environment. Sites can be accessed by faculty and students from any computer platform using any browser. ETUDES-NG  is used extensively for the delivery of hybrid and online instruction and for the enhancement and management of traditional instruction by hundreds of faculty. It is the standard online course delivery system of the ETUDES Alliance, a consortium of over 30 institutions, mostly community colleges in California. </p>
			<p>ETUDES-NG is a set of open source software tools built upon the Sakai platform, an open source higher-education project for creating open source collaborative tools for use in teaching, learning, and research.</p>
			<p>ETUDES (Easy to Use Distance Education Software) was inspired by Michael Loceff, computer science professor at Foothill College, in 1994. ETUDES has matured due to the enthusiasm, commitment, and contributions of faculty, students, support staff, and administrators. ETUDES is managed by Foothill College and has evolved during a period of  10 years to the next generation, ETUDES-NG. It continues to evolve thanks to the collective vision of our users and active members of the ETUDES Alliance &amp; Sakai higher education communities. </p>
